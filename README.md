# The Smart Kitchen - Nutrition Tracking System

Aims to minimize human error involved in tracking nutrition, giving users a much better understanding of their nutritional intake, and providing insights into how they can achieve a healthier lifestyle. Additionally, the system strives to significantly reduce the psychological burden associated with manually tracking personal nutritional intake through current methods. These solutions contribute towards reducing complexity and increasing the motivation of individuals to lead a healthy lifestyle regarding nutrition.

The system consists of four main components which communicate wirelessly:
1) The server
2) The database
3) The mobile application
4) Module

An overview of the system and the communication between the components can be seen the figure below.
